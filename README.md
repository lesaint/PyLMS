Lacune MÃ©morielle Sociale for Python
====================================

I have a long living issue to remember people names, history and relationships.
Let's see how computer software could help improve (or fix, why not!) this situation.


Purpose of the project
======================

The functional scope of this project is only a pretext for exploring, learning and practicing.

It is also a support for demonstrating my autonomous work to learn new technologies and process, revolving around `Python`.

1. Python language and standard lib knowledge and practice
2. Python desktop UI frameworks (`tkinter` and `PySide6`) knowledge and practice
3. Python testing frameworks (standard `unittest`, migrating Ward and GUI testing framework) knowledge and practice
4. Python web framework (`Flask`) exploration and practice
5. Experiment with Graph database usage (`GraphDB`?, `Neo4J`?)
6. The evolution process from a command line Proof-of-concept product, to a GUI-based program, to a server-based monolith program to a scaling SAAS service
7. Project management with a tool I don't know: [linear](https://linear.app)
8. CI/CD with Github actions and move to another tool (CircleCI?)
9. Pythonic and clean programming


Work and time management
========================

Pomodoro
--------

Apply the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) for time management.

I'll be using [Pomatez](https://github.com/zidoro/pomatez) as a Pomodoro tool.

I'll work in rounds of 25 minutes, sets of 4 rounds in a row, 5 minutes breaks in between and 15 min break at the end.

This implies a realistic 2 sets a day target.

Sprint simulation
-----------------

Working in 20 minutes rounds is also a mean to emulate working in sprints, with a timebox and a feeling of urgency, but at a scale where 25 minute rounds represent a single day.

The later is a mean to ensure this project is fast-paced and quickly beneficial.

Health, work and work-balance benefits
--------------------------------------

Additional reasons to use the Pomodoro technique:

* Force me to take breaks:
	* ease on my eyes getting impacted by all these years looking at a computer screen
	* fight the impacts of the sitting position
* Focus on work and use breaks for the small home related stuff
* Become an advanced practitioner of the technique so that I'm really able to use it at work once I get back on a job (previous attempts in the past weren't successful)

Project management
==================

Tooling
-------

This project is an opportunity to experiment with a new tool: [linear](https://linear.app).

It appears to have (to confirm with practice):

* integration with Github for issue workflow
* a roadmap feature to draw and track the project's steps and milestones
* free usage
