Lacune MÃ©morielle Sociale for Python
====================================

I have a long living issue to remember people names, history and relationships.
Let's see how computer software could help improve (or fix, why not!) this situation.


Purpose of the project
======================

The functional scope of this project is only a pretext for exploring, learning and practicing.

It is also a support for demonstrating my autonomous work to learn new technologies and process, revolving around `Python`.

Why `Python`?
-------------

I'm a `Java` developer since out of school (15 years at least).

I've been using `Python` since 2022 for AWS CDK-based projects, writing data analysis notebooks with `panda`, `numpi`, `seaborn`, etc. and some scripting programs to run my backup strategy accross NAS and family member computers at home.

I learned `Python` ad hoc.

However, discussions with colleagues made me realize that I was "only" coding `Java` (or `bash` for scripting) with the `Python` language.

This isn't good.

In my whole life, I am commited to do things the right way. I have to learn and use `Python` the right way.

Plus (with no order of importance):

* I liked the language so far for itself and because it challenged me in my Java-way of looking at coding
* I'm currently on the job market and `Python` is the trending programming language
* `Python` is frequently used (along with `Go`) for projects I'm interrested into (cloud-based ones, data-based ones, AI-based ones), more than `Java`

Why this project?
-----------------

So, I took leaving my job in February 2024 as an opportunity to learn `Python` from the ground up, autonomously, reading and practicing [Dead Simple Python](https://nostarch.com/dead-simple-python) from start to end.

I then took practice exams [purchased on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-associate-professional-python-pcap-pcpp1/) for the [PCAP](https://pythoninstitute.org/pcap) [PCPP1](https://pythoninstitute.org/pcpp1) certifications, with the initial intent to pass them.

I succeeded at both of them, 1st try.

The ease of the certification made me doubt they would be enough to validate, prove and demonstrate my learning.

A practical project will achieve this better.

Why English?
------------

I've been coding, writing and communicating in English for 10 years, both at work and for personal code and documentation.

I continue to target English-based jobs.

Scope of the project
====================

Python and Python ecosystem
---------------------------

1. Python language and standard lib
2. Python desktop UI frameworks (`tkinter` and then migrating to `PySide6`)
3. Python testing frameworks (standard `unittest`, migrating Ward and GUI testing framework)
4. Python web framework (`Flask`) exploration and practice
5. Pythonic and clean programming
6. Documentation with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/)
	* THE doc tool for Python
	* I want to experiment with [reStructuredText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html)
7. Pythonic SQL with [sqlite3](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html)

New technology exploration
--------------------------

1. Experiment with Graph database usage (`GraphDB`?, `Neo4J`?)
	* I'm proficient with relational, practitioner with document, never used graph
2. Project management with a tool I don't know: [linear](https://linear.app)
	* get out of confort-zone
3. CI/CD with [Dagger](https://dagger.io/) on Circle-CI: https://docs.dagger.io/integrations/592501/circleci
	* [KISS](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principe_KISS) starting with Github actions
	* Circle-CI seem to be quite popular and I've seen it on Job posting
	* Dagger's concept is pretty could (and Python-based)

Architecting demonstration
--------------------------

Evolves the program from a command line Proof-of-concept, to a GUI-based desktop app, to a server-based monolith program app, to a browser-based program, to a scaling SAAS service with microservices:

1. explore and practice the whole variety of `Python` based programs
2. demonstrate and practice architecting skills at all stages and handling migrations



Work and time management
========================

Pomodoro
--------

Apply the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) for time management.

I'll be using [Pomatez](https://github.com/zidoro/pomatez) as a Pomodoro tool.

I'll work in rounds of 25 minutes, sets of 4 rounds in a row, 5 minutes breaks in between.

This implies a realistic 2 sets a day target.

Sprint simulation
-----------------

I intent to simulate a day with one 25 minutes round and weekly sprints with a set of 4 rounds:

* ensure the project is fast-paced, quickly beneficial and doesn't last forever
* push the timebox approach and the feeling of urgency I practiced for 9 years to a limit and see what happens


Health, work and work-balance benefits
--------------------------------------

Additional reasons to use the Pomodoro technique:

* Force me to take breaks:
	* ease on my eyes getting impacted by all these years looking at a computer screen
	* fight the impacts of the sitting position
* Focus on work and use breaks for the small home related stuff
* Become an advanced practitioner of the technique so that I'm really able to use it at work once I get back on a job (previous attempts in the past weren't successful)

Project management
==================

Tooling
-------

This project is an opportunity to experiment with a new tool: [linear](https://linear.app).

It appears to have (to confirm with practice):

* integration with Github for issue workflow
* a roadmap feature to draw and track the project's steps and milestones
* free usage
