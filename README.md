Lacune MÃ©morielle Sociale for Python
====================================

The functional scope (see below) of this project is a pretext and a support for demonstrating:

1. Python language and standard lib knowledge and practice
2. Python desktop UI frameworks (`tkinter` and `PySide6`) knowledge and practice
3. Python testing frameworks (standard `unittest`, migrating Ward and GUI testing framework) knowledge and practice
4. Python web framework (`Flask`) exploration and practice
5. Experiment with Graph database usage (`GraphDB`?, `Neo4J`?)
6. The evolution process from a command line Proof-of-concept product, to a GUI-based program, to a server-based monolith program to a scaling SAAS service
7. Project management with a tool I don't know: [linear](https://linear.app)
8. CI/CD with Github actions and move to another tool (CircleCI?)
9. Pythonic and clean programming


Fonctional scope
================

I have a long living issue to remember people names, history and relationships.
Let's see how computer software could help improve (or fix, why not!) this situation.
